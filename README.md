🛍 Retail Sales Analytics for Predictive Insights & Business Recommendations
📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on leveraging machine learning to enhance sales forecasting and business decision-making in the retail sector. By analyzing historical sales data, promotions, and store-specific factors, the project delivers actionable insights to optimize inventory management, markdowns, and operational efficiency.

🚀 Business Problem
Retailers face challenges in demand forecasting, inventory optimization, and revenue maximization. Poor forecasting can lead to stockouts or excess inventory, affecting profitability. This project aims to:

Improve sales forecasting accuracy
Optimize promotional strategies
Enhance customer satisfaction and operational efficiency
🔍 Proposed Solution
We implemented advanced machine learning models, with a focus on the Extra Trees Regressor, to enhance sales predictions. Key components include:

Feature Engineering: Incorporating historical sales, promotions, and store attributes
Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing model parameters for better accuracy
Model Selection: Comparing traditional and advanced models to find the best performer
📊 Data Processing & EDA
Merged multiple datasets for comprehensive analysis
Handled missing values using forward-fill (categorical) and median imputation (numerical)
Outlier detection using the IQR method and log transformation
Multicollinearity removal with Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)
Time series decomposition & moving average analysis to capture trends
🏆 Model Evaluation
We tested multiple models and found Random Forest Regressor to be the best performer.

Model	MSE	R²	MAPE	SMAPE
Linear Regression	High	Low	Poor	Poor
Decision Tree	Moderate	Overfits	Moderate	Moderate
Random Forest	✅ Lowest	✅ Highest	✅ Best	✅ Best
Extra Trees	Good	Slightly under Random Forest	Good	Good
Gradient Boosting	Unstable	Sensitive to tuning	Moderate	Moderate
Key Findings:
Random Forest performed the best, balancing accuracy, bias, and variance
Linear models underperformed, failing to capture complex patterns
Decision Trees tend to overfit, but ensemble methods improved results
🔮 Future Work
Hyperparameter Tuning: Using GridSearchCV and Bayesian Optimization
Ensemble Learning: Combining XGBoost, Random Forest, and Linear Models
Advanced Feature Engineering: Incorporating external factors like holidays and promotions
Time Series Forecasting: Exploring ARIMA and Prophet models
Deployment & Business Impact: Automating updates and integrating dashboards
📌 Conclusion
This project highlights the power of machine learning in retail analytics. By integrating predictive models, businesses can make data-driven decisions, improving sales forecasting, inventory management, and profitability.
